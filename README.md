## General Information

Background:
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally, with melanoma being the deadliest form. Early detection of skin cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, diagnosing skin lesions accurately can be challenging, even for experienced dermatologists. Automated classification systems can assist dermatologists in the diagnosis process by providing quick and accurate analysis of skin lesion images.

Business Problem:
The business problem addressed by this project is the need for an efficient and accurate system for classifying skin lesions. By developing an automated classification system, healthcare providers can improve the speed and accuracy of skin cancer diagnosis, leading to earlier detection, timely treatment, and better patient outcomes.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset. It consists of high-quality dermoscopic images of skin lesions, along with corresponding diagnostic labels. The dataset contains images of various types of skin lesions, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and benign nevi. Each image is labeled with its corresponding diagnosis, making it suitable for training machine learning models for skin lesion classification.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 The overfitting condition in model_1 occurred after we performed some class balance in the dataset.
- Conclusion 2 after the augmentation and class balance process the accuracy is good enough
